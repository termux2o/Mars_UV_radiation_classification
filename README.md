# Mars_UV_radiation_classification
this ML model classifies the UV_radiation class based on temperature and pressure 
**UV Radiation Classification Model README**

## Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that classifies UV radiation levels based on temperature and pressure inputs. The model utilizes a supervised learning approach to predict UV radiation classes from the given features.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided example notebook)
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ytermux2o/Mars_UV_radiation_classification.git
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your dataset is formatted properly with columns for temperature, pressure, and UV radiation class labels.

2. **Training the Model**: Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model on your dataset. Alternatively, you can create your own script using the provided model code.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can be used to predict UV radiation classes for new temperature and pressure values.

## Example
Check the provided example notebook (`Mars_Uv_radiation_classification_model.ipynb`) for a step-by-step demonstration of how to use the model.

## Model Performance
The model's performance can vary based on the quality of the dataset and the chosen machine learning algorithm. It's recommended to experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to achieve the best results.
